This code is using Neville’s method to find the 2nd degree interpolating value for f(3.7) for set of data.
It is also using Newton’s forward method to print out the polynomial approximations for degrees 1, 2,
and 3. Also, Using the divided difference method to print out the Hermite polynomial approximation
matrix. Lastly, using cubic spline interpolation to solve for matrix A, vector b, and vector x using set of data
